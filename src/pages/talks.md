The NLLP Talks series brings together researchers from academia and industry working at the intersection of law and NLP. The group convenes every month and explores recent research in this multidisciplinary space. By featuring presenters and discussants from complementary disciplines, the NLLP Talks series aims to further bridge law and computational linguistics. If you are interested in joining any of the events, presenting or discussing recent work, do reach out to us on the [Slack channel](https://join.slack.com/t/nllp/shared_invite/zt-qrjzyncj-5Rq4AXnMKQVLkwWSQknRHw)!
