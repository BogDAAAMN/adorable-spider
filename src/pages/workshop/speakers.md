## Sylvie Delacroix (Birmingham Law & Alan Turing Institute)

**Title**: Data Trusts as a Bottom-up Empowerment Tool

**Abstract**: This presentation will focus on data trusts as a bottom-up empowerment tool. It will proceed from an analysis of the particular type of vulnerability concomitant with our 'leaking' data on a daily basis, to argue that data ownership is both unlikely and inadequate as an answer to the problems at stake. 
There are three key problems that bottom-up data trusts seek to address:

- Lack of mechanisms to empower groups, not just individuals
- We can (and should) do better than 'make belief' consent.
- We can (and should) do better when it comes to intelligent data sharing.

**Bio**: Sylvie Delacroix focuses on the intersection between law and ethics, with a particular interest in Data and Machine Ethics, Agency and the role of habit within moral decisions (Habitual Ethics?,  Bloomsbury / Hart Publishing, 2021). Her current research focuses on the design of computer systems meant for morally-loaded contexts. She is also considering the potential inherent in ['bottom-up' Data Trusts](https://doi.org/10.1093/idpl/ipz014) as a mechanism to address power imbalances between data-subjects and data-controllers. Professor Delacroix’s work has notably been funded by the Wellcome Trust, the NHS and the Leverhulme Trust, from whom she received the Leverhulme Prize. Professor Delacroix was one of three appointed commissioners on the Public Policy Commission on the use of algorithms in the justice system (Law Society of England and Wales), which released its report on 04 June 2019. She is a Fellow of the Alan Turing Institute and a Mozilla Fellow. Visit the [Data Trusts](https://datatrusts.uk/) website - a new site co-created by Sylvie that brings together information about data trusts, with the aim of helping advance debate about their use.
