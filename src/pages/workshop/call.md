## Goal

Following the success of the first two editions of the NLLP workshop (NAACL 2019, KDD 2020), we aim to bring researchers and practitioners from NLP, machine learning and other artificial intelligence disciplines together with legal practitioners and researchers. We welcome submissions describing original work on:

- **Applications and experimental results of NLP in legal tasks** including: Legal Citation Resolution, Case Outcome Analysis and Prediction, Models of Legal Reasoning, E-Discovery, Legal Document Summarization, Information Extraction, Information Retrieval, Bias and Privacy, etc.;
- **New tasks**: Description of new legal tasks for NLP, structured overviews of a specific task with the goal of identifying new areas for research;
- **Position papers** presenting new visions, challenges and changes to existing research practices;
- **Resources**: Creation of publicly available curated and/or annotated data sets that can be used by the community;
- **Demos**: System descriptions using NLP on legal data and industrial applications.

## Submission

We accept papers reporting original (unpublished) research of two types:
- Long papers (max 6 pages + references)
- Short papers (max 3 pages + references)

To submit a paper, please access the [submission link]().

Conference proceedings will be published on the CEUR Workshop Proceedings.

### Non-archival option

The authors have the option of submitting previously unpublished research as non-archival, meaning that only the abstract will be published in the conference proceedings. We expect these submissions to describe the same quality of work as archival submissions. These will be reviewed following the same procedure as archival submissions. This option accommodates publication of the work or a superset at a later date in a conference or journal which does not allow previously archived work and to encourage presentation and feedback on mature, yet unpublished work.

### Dual Submission Policy

Papers that have been or will be submitted to workshops, conferences or journals during the review period must indicate so at submission time. Authors of papers accepted for presentation at the NLLP workshop 2021 must notify the organizers by the camera-ready deadline as to whether the paper will be presented or withdrawn.

If the preliminary version of a paper was posted in arXiv, the authors should NOT mention as their own paper in the submission. Papers that violate the double-blind review requirements will be desk rejected. 

**Exception**: Submissions with the non-archival option are excepted from this requirement. 

### Double-Blind reviewing

The review process is double-blind. Submitted papers must not include author names and affiliations and they must be written in a way so that they do not break the double-blind reviewing process. If the preliminary version of a paper was posted in arXiv, the authors should NOT mention as their own paper in the submission. Papers that violate the double-blind review requirements will be desk rejected.

### Submission Style & Format Guidelines

Submissions to the workshop must be in PDF and formatted according to the new Standard ACM Conference Proceedings Template. For LaTeX users: unzip acmart.zip, make, and use sample-sigconf.tex as a template.
Additional information about formatting and style files is available online at: https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template.
Papers that do not meet the formatting requirements will be rejected without review.
