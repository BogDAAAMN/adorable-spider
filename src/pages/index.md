## Goal

The NLLP workshop series explores methods and applications of Natural Language Processing (NLP) for the Legal Domain by focusing on 1. legal text; and 2. text with legal significance. On the one hand, legal text (e.g., case law, legal rules, contracts) has distinct characteristics such as specialised vocabulary, particularly formal syntax, domain-specific semantics etc., to the extent that legal language is often classified as a ”sublanguage”, i.e. legalese which makes it challenging for generic NLP tools to work accurately. Developing novel NLP for legal text methods holds the promise of transforming the legal services sector (the US Legal Services market alone is valued at $211 billion according to US government price indices). On the other hand, the Internet is full of text with legal significance (e.g. detecting advertising language, dark patterns etc.), especially since national and supranational regulators have been paving the way to a new market focused on public interest technology such as consumer forensics. The interest of public authorities in developing market monitoring tools is at an all-time high, yet relevant multidisciplinary research expertise remains scattered.

The growth and recognition of Legal NLP as an important research area is evidenced by the fact that legal NLP papers have recently been presented at the main sessions of top NLP conferences (including EMNLP 2019, ACL 2019, ACL 2020), some of which with preliminary versions presented at this workshop. The 2020 COLING CfP also lists Legal NLP as a distinct application domain.


## Motivation

NLP technologies allow legal practitioners and decision-makers to make more informed decisions, optimize legal strategies and serve clients/consumers/citizens in a more cost-efficient way. The fast-paced, multi-jurisdictional world of law is a growing area of application for NLP, offering data sources which are often multilingual and multimodal. For example, evidentiary data sets used in private and public legal practice require in-depth image analysis and speech recognition technologies complement text data (e.g., opinions and judgments) currently dominating the area. Hence, the legal domain has enormous potential for generating interesting research problems on a par with other commercial areas such as Finance, Clinical Psychology and Healthcare, for which NLP-specific workshops have a strong history (FinNL, BioNLP, CLPsych, Clinical NLP among others). At the same time, legal NLP research can equally create societal impact by informing regulators how to best protect certain categories of citizens at risk (e.g. vulnerable consumers), or by enhancing citizen education and access to justice. The growth and recognition of Legal NLP as an important research area is evidenced by the fact that legal NLP papers have recently been presented at the main sessions of top NLP conferences (including EMNLP 2019, ACL 2019, ACL 2020), some of which with preliminary versions presented at this workshop. The 2020 COLING CfP also lists Legal NLP as a distinct application domain.

Following the success of the first two editions of the NLLP workshop (NAACL 2019, KDD 2020), we aim to bring researchers and practitioners from NLP, machine learning and other artificial intelligence disciplines together with legal practitioners and researchers. We welcome submissions describing original work on:

- **Applications and experimental results of NLP in legal tasks including**: Legal Citation Resolution, Case Outcome Analysis and Prediction, Models of Legal Reasoning, E-Discovery, Legal Document Summarization, Information Extraction, Information Retrieval, Bias and Privacy, etc.;
- **New tasks**: Description of new legal tasks for NLP, structured overviews of a specific task with the goal of identifying new areas for research;
- **Position papers** presenting new visions, challenges and changes to existing research practices;
- **Resources**: Creation of publicly available curated and/or annotated data sets that can be used by the community;
- **Demos**: System descriptions using NLP on legal data and industrial applications.
